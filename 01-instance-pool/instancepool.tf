# Instance Pool
# The pool maintains the desired number of instances across multiple ADs,
# automatically replacing unhealthy instances. Placement configurations spread
# instances across AD-1 and AD-2 so the application stays available if one
# AD has an outage. The pool is registered directly with the load balancer
# backend set — new instances are added to rotation as they pass health checks,
# and removed when terminated during a scale-in event.

# Autoscaling Configuration
# CPU utilization drives all scaling decisions. OCI threshold policies fire
# when the metric crosses the threshold — the cool-down period prevents rapid
# repeated actions before load stabilizes.
#
# Unlike AWS (separate CloudWatch alarms with configurable evaluation periods),
# OCI threshold policies react immediately when the threshold is crossed. The
# 300s cool-down fills the same protective role: it prevents scale-in during
# short quiet periods and scale-out storms on sudden load spikes.
